# Survenir
Just some jibbi-jabba to play in my free time


This web page will consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL, thorugh React and Sequelize.

Survenir is the name of a small company my father has, he already has a web page but I would like to reinvent it. By asking what he would like I can experience that odd relationship between customer and creator, trying to meet and understand my client´s desires. 
I will only be working on this on my free time, as I am studying at university, and that is my priority.
I don´t think someone will ever read this, but just in case.
